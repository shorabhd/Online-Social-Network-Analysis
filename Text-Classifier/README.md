## Assignment 2
 
In this assignment, you will build a text classifier to determine whether a
movie review is expressing positive or negative sentiment. The data come from
the website IMDB.com.
 
You'll write code to preprocess the data in different ways (creating different
features), then compare the cross-validation accuracy of each approach. Then,
you'll compute accuracy on a test set and do some analysis of the errors.
 
The main method takes about 40 seconds for me to run on my laptop. Places to
check for inefficiency include the vectorize function and the
eval_all_combinations function.
